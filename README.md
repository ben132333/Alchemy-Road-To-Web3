# Alchemy-Road-To-Web3
10-week Road to Web3 course to become a web3 dev by Alchemy

## Week 1: Develop an NFT Smart Contract (ERC721) with Alchemy
  - Used the OpenZeppelin Wizard to create a ERC-721 contract: https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/wizard
  - Set up Alchemy App to access the Rinkeby testnet
  - Used the Remix browser IDE to customise, compile, and deploy the smart contract on the Rinkeby test net
  - The contract address: https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x95f48bc7013cad731339d3aede852e5a1c9bf9db
  - Created the NFT metadata, following the Opensea metadata standards: https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards
  - Uploaded the image and the metadata json file to IPFS to mint the NFT: 
    - ipfs://QmUd3Nu7xyJigViChGpDdqg1NaA6xnKYjTfgkcF6Yy3LQq
  - Minted one NFT using the deployed smart contract, running safeMint: https://testnets.opensea.io/assets/rinkeby/0x95f48bc7013cad731339d3aede852e5a1c9bf9db/0
